Profiles gas consumption of a transaction line-by-line.

Uses `debug_traceTransaction`, for which geth must run with `--rpcapi debug,eth` flag. Note that ganache supports this API but the return is different from geth, which I suspect is a bug and will examine further later. Currently does not work with ganache.

Requires sourcemap, which is produced by `solc --combined-json srcmap-runtime`.

Command line:
`node profile.js <RPC endpoint> <tx hash> <.sol file path> <sourcemap file path>`

Sample output for profiling `foo(10)`:
```
